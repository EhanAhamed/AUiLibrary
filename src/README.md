So you're reading this because you're me from the future and you forgot the difference between a component, an item, a layout, and a utility. (Or you're some random stranger from the internet thats stalking me, hi!)

Components are combinations of layouts items and utilitys

Components are objects with many things in them, like a modal/alert for example.

Items are singular objects, like a button.

Layouts are grid systems and positioning and scaling systems that help align items to create components.

Utilities are other systems that help the mainly css ui interact with the mainly js ui and/or the backend.
